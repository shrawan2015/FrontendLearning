-  An **argument** is a _value_ that you pass to the function. 
- A **parameter** is the variable inside the function that will hold that value. 
- A function lets you define a block of code that performs a task. Then, whenever your app needs to execute that task, you can run the function instead of having to copy and paste the same code everywhere.
- “Function parameters are constants by default, which means they can’t be modified.”
- “Functions in Kotlin are simply another data type. You can assign them to variables and constants just as you can any other type of value, such as an Int or a String.”
