Scope functions in Kotlin are essential constructs that simplify the code structure by providing concise ways to perform operations on objects within a specific scope. These functions include let, run, with, apply, and also.

- let: Executes a given block of code on a non-null object and returns the result.
- run: It is similar to let, but used with extension functions and allows access to the object’s properties without the need for the explicit reference.
- with: Takes an object and a lambda expression as parameters, allowing direct access to the object’s members without the need for the explicit reference.
- apply: Applies a lambda expression to an object and returns the modified object. It is useful for initializing object properties.
- also: Performs additional actions on an object and returns the same object. It is used for logging or performing side effects.
