“All you need to do is put the name of the class or interface you’re extending before the name of the function you’re adding. This class name is called the receiver type; the value on which you’re calling the extension function is called the receiver object.


“In an extension function declaration, the receiver type is the type on which the extension is defined. You use it to specify the type your function extends. The receiver object is the instance of that type. You use it to access properties and methods of the type you’re extending.”


**Receiver Object:**

- The object on which the extension function is called is known as the “receiver object.”
- Inside the extension function, the receiver object is accessed using the `this` keyword, granting the function access to its properties and methods.
